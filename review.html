        <h1>Oct ‘22 - Day 1 - I Started Off With A Poor Choice.  “Glorious” → 4/10.</h1>
        <h6>October 1, 2022 <span style="font-style:italic">by</span> SGTDIDDLYWINK </h6>
        <p>October just hit and to say I’m excited would be an understatement… and yet I still managed to screw it up on day 1.</p>
        <p>It was my turn for first choice this year and like every year before this one, I was not at all prepared.  This isn’t a big deal because that’s what google is for.  I’ll throw in some flavor text with my search like, “best”, “2022”, and/or “Korean”(Korea knows how to make some spectacular horror movies).  In mere milliseconds, google saves me once again and now I have more choices than I know what to do with.</p>
        <p>I religiously believe that part of what makes a good horror movie is not knowing what is going to happen.  Therefore, I try my best to avoid reading the descriptions or watching any trailers to avoid those bgi scare scenes.</p>
        <p>This makes choosing movies a bit difficult so I do what I always do and fervently deny ever doing it.  “I choose the one that has the coolest name or picture”.  No one needs to enlighten me to the, “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover” saying.  I do it and chastise myself for it.  Maybe one day I will stop but that day is not today.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, my terrible means of selecting movies led me to choosing “Glorious”.</p>
        <p>Heads up, there be spoilers ahead.</p>
        <p>The overall concept/idea behind this movie fascinates me.  A demi-god wreaking havoc on a presumed serial killer by mentally torturing them to the point of cutting a piece of their own liver out?  That is a new one for me and the more I think about how you could flesh out a story around it, the more I wonder how “Glorious” managed to completely F*** it up.</p>
        <p>Let’s go down a quick list here:
        <ul>
          <li>Was it the slow turn into toilet humor in a matter of a few minutes?</li>
          <li>The mysterious character at the beginning that they decided to never explain?  My theory (absolutely no evidence behind this) is that someone knew someone important and managed to get into the movie.</li>
          <li>Oh how about how the demi-god miraculously runs out of power at just the right time when someone shows up.</li>
          <li>There are a lot more and I don’t want to continue on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To say the least, this was a bad implementation of what I think could have been a fantastic concept and that irritates me more than the movie just being a bad movie.</p>
        <p>I really like unique storylines and plot twists that haven’t been continuously abused for the last 50 years.  The basic premise behind “Glorious” had that potential to really wow me but instead...  they decided to throw it in the S****** just like the setting.</p>
        <p>The only reason this movie get’s a 4 is because I’m still just focusing on what it could have been.  I can’t escape that gnawing sensation that there may have been gold here and instead the production team threw some poop jokes for some crappy laughs.</p>
        <p>And for what?</p>
        <p>I have no idea but if anyone else does, please let me know.</p>
        <p>Like my partner told me, the scariest thing about this movie was the main character touching the toilet seat and wiping his hands on his face.  My recommendation is to spend an hour and 17minutes or so on something slightly more enjoyable.  Like taxes or finally fixing that clogged sink.</p>

        <h6>September 21, 2022 <span style="font-style:italic">by</span> SGTDIDDLYWINK </h6>
        <p>Similar to everything else on this website, I hope to one day populate this with reviews.  I’ll probably start with the easy things like video games, books, and movies.</p>
        <p>I read a lot (actually I listen but close enough) of books and have been hooked on a couple podcasts.  Lately, it's been a podcast called Darknet Diaries (Highly Recommend).</p>
        <p>Generally, I don’t watch a lot of movies but October is right around the corner and that is where things get particularly fun.  My partner and I have a yearly tradition to watch a horror movie every day of the month of October.  We’re going on year 4 now and I have seen some truly horrific s***.  Both in a bad way and a good way.</p>
        <p>I play a lot of games.  There is one in particular that is at the top of my mind that I’ll be targeting.  It’s a special love/hate relation but I just hit a 1000 hrs in the game and truly feel ashamed about it.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye out as these will be sporadic and involve a lot of pointless rambling.</p>
