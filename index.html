        <p>This is my first website that I have built from the ground up using Atom.  It's a work in progress so keep looking for more updates as they come.  This won't get published for a little while as I'm still adding and messing with things as I figure them out.  Hopefully, I'll get to keep doing this and start showcasing some of my projects here.</p>
