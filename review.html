        <p>Similar to everything else on this website, I hope to one day populate this with reviews.  I’ll probably start with the easy things like video games, books, and movies.</p>
        <p>I read a lot (actually I listen but close enough) of books and have been hooked on a couple podcasts.  Lately, it's been a podcast called Darknet Diaries (Highly Recommend).</p>
        <p>Generally, I don’t watch a lot of movies but October is right around the corner and that is where things get particularly fun.  My partner and I have a yearly tradition to watch a horror movie every day of the month of October.  We’re going on year 4 now and I have seen some truly horrific stuff.  Both in a bad way and a good way.</p>
        <p>I play a lot of games.  There is one in particular that is at the top of my mind that I’ll be targeting.  It’s a special love/hate relation but I just hit a 1000 hrs in the game and truly feel ashamed about it.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye out as these will be sporadic and involve a lot of pointless rambling.</p>
