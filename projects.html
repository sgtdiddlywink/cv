        <p>Let's call this website my first published project.  A lot of folks probably wouldn't say it was much but I'm pretty damn proud of it.  Especially after I saw how easy it is to create a website on wordpress or one of those other websites.</p>
        <p>I feel kind dumb for writing out all of this and doing the formatting myself but overall still proud of it.  So I know most of you could easily inspect the source to determine where this is being hosted from but I'll make it simple and official with a link to my first github repository.  Here's to hoping I'll get around to more.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/sgtdiddlywink/sgtdiddlywink_website">GitHub Link for the sgtdiddlywink Website.</a>
        <p>Once I get this website polished and looking a bit better I want to start cleaning up some of my python projects to upload to github.  Nothing fancy, just little projects to help me learn.  Stay tuned for more updates there.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, I'll be working on Tildaloo's website.  Hopefully, that one won't be as much of a struggle bus for me as this one has been.</p>
