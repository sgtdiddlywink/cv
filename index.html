        <p>In all honesty I have no idea what to expect from this website and I think that’s okay.</p>
        <p>I find it funny that the only reason I am here now is because the python course I have been taking decided to introduce us to HTML and CSS so we could learn how to use beautifulsoup.  Fast forward a week later and bam! Website.</p>
        <p>And you know what?  I don’t absolutely hate it.  I do hate it but no longer feel ashamed of it.  It’s actually something that 1.) works and 2.) doesn’t look like complete html 90’s garbage.  I’m talking about the website, btw.</p>
        <p>It’s been almost a year since I bought a book on learning python (<span style="font-style:italic">Python Crash Course by Eric Matthews</span>). and I’m not sure if I should be happy or sad with my progress.  On one hand, I think I have a pretty good understanding of the basics of python but on the other hand, I feel like I'm a baby who is just learning to walk without falling on their face.</p>
        <p>I’ve learned a lot though.  This website being my first truly 100% (DIY) project.  It’s not python but python got me here so I’ll take it.</p>
        <p>Diving into the coding world has brought forth a ton of joy that I haven’t felt in quite a while.  Coding though has a certain sense of wonderment.  I feel like any project is attainable and doable (within reason) which just seems really freaking cool.</p>
        <p>I think I’m going to leave it at that because I can’t seem to put coherent thoughts down on paper anymore. </p>

        <h1>Hi! Welcome To My Website.  I'm Just Writing A Bunch Of Stuff To Take Up Space And Break This Site's Formatting... Is It Working?</h1>

        <p>This is my first website that I have built from the ground up using Atom.  It's a work in progress so keep looking for more updates as they come.  This won't get published for a little while as I'm still adding and messing with things as I figure them out.  Hopefully, I'll get to keep doing this and start showcasing some of my projects here.</p>
